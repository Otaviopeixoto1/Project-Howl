# Howl
A small personal project meant for learning some core concepts of the Unity engine.

## Objectives
- Improve my knowledge on the game development cycle by creating and mantaining a small game in Unity.
- Use 3D and 2D modeling tools such as Blender and Aseprite for authoring assets.    
- Create a simplified framework for procedurally generating worlds with different biomes.
- Learn about GPU instancing by rendering the vegetation on the procedurally generated terrain.
- Learn about unity's URP (and the SRPs in general) customization by using the ScriptableRendererFeatures to apply unique effects to the scene rendering. In this case I chose to go for the 3D pixel art style as shown in t3ssel8r's channel: https://www.youtube.com/@t3ssel8r
